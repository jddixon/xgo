    * FIX: xgoT is incorrectly appending / to prefix specified          * DONE

    * HANDLE: apply.go about line 73 Lookup returns nil

2013-11-28
    * when Apply does a lookup in the context and the symbol is
        not there, error msg is completely opaque. Need to add 
        an explanation interpreting the error from Context.Lookup().

    * FIX BUG: doubled dollar signs in input cause Apply() to           * DONE
        leave expression unresolved                                     * DONE
    * FIX BUG 2:  handle $ at end of file                               * DONE
    * processor_test must NOT use .go as outputExc: change!             * DONE

    * xgo/cmd/xgoT _must_ put .go extension on output files
    * modify processor_test.go to write context to scratch 
        directory

2013-11-26
    * write skeletal xgo/cmd/xgoT/xgoT.go command line processor        * DONE
    * if the output directory does not exist, should make it; 0755      * DONE
        should be OK.  os.MkdirAll(path, 0755)                          * DONE
    * add any unprocessed args after call to flag.Parse() to            * DONE
        Options.FileNames                                               * DONE
    * write xgo/template/processor.go which the above invokes           * DONE

    * modify test to use bytes.Buffer
        - drop xgo/util/byte_buffer.go if this works

    * test dollar as last character in file                             * DONE
    * modify to allow only well-formed symbols within ${}
        - initial character should be drawn from a designated set
        - other characters from a presumably larger but still 
            limited set
        - spaces (those for which IsSpace() is true) must be 
            excluded
    * Need Apply test on file much larger than the buffer being used
