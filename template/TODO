xgo/template/TODO

2013-11-26
    * write skeletal xgo/cmd/xgoT/xgoT.go command line processor        * DONE
    * write xgo/template/processor.go which the above invokes

    * modify test to use bytes.Buffer
        - drop xgo/util/byte_buffer.go if this works

    * test dollar as last character in file
    * modify to allow only well-formed symbols within ${}
        - initial character should be drawn from a designated set
        - other characters from a presumably larger but still 
            limited set
        - spaces (those for which IsSpace() is true) must be 
            excluded
    * Need Apply test on file much larger than the buffer being used
