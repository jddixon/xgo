xgo/context/TODO

2012-12-03 (from 12-01)
    * Serialization of nested context: comment as first line:
        - ^#PARENT: parent_name$
        - parent_name is simple name, no whitespace (but we trim)

2013-12-03 (from 11-24, then 12-01)
    * add a hash to ensure data integrity
        - SHA3-256, last line in file, as comment
        - ^#HASH: xxxxx...xxx$
        - write exactly like that, but trim anyway

2013-12-01
    * Modify ParserContext() to allow comments begining with #          * DONE
