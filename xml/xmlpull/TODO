    * parseProlog must be restructured to better match the xml 1.0 
        syntax graph
        - xml 1.1 compliance can be introduced later as an option or as 
            a feature of a different parser
    * the test for \uFFFE could be moved to whatever calls parseProlog
    * the call to parseProlog should NOT be in next.go's Next() 
    * implement parseProlog_test.go 
    * tentatively: all parser components should produce an xml object
        (as in ../om/) which is then serialized to match the xmlpull
        spec in a separate step.  That is, the xmlpull parser produces
        objects, putting them in convetional places, and then the call
        to the interface serializes those objects into the form called
        for by the xmlpull spec

    * drop string interning code; rune slices can't be interned			* DONE
        (at least not at reasonable cost in dev man-hours)			    * DONE
    * any ifs on allStringsInterned: drop the true branch			    * DONE

    * parseStartTag needs parseAttribute()                              * DONE
    * and getNamespace()                                                * DONE

    * test printable*()
    * test charTests.go

2013-12-07
    * verify lexer.go has all functions in xgo/lex/lex_input.go
        - and rearrange the latter into alphabetical order
    * parseXmlDecl must collect its runes, add to Parser struct

    * build skeletal parser as parser.go                                * DONE
        - be able to read and parse first line
            * parseXmlDecl()

    * write parser_test.go, initially testing that reset() works 
        as expected
