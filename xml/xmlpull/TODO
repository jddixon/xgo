    * REVIEW decision to always set p.curEvent when returning
        curEvent

    * get rudimentary parser working (ISSUE#5)
        document ::= prolog element Misc*
        element  ::= EmptyElemTag
        prolog   ::= XMLDecl? Misc* (doctypedecl) 
        Misc     ::= Comment | S
    * Misc* implemented as Parser.acceptMisc

    * parseProlog must be restructured to better match the xml 1.0 
        syntax graph
    * the test for \uFFFE should be moved to whatever calls parseProlog
    * the call to parseProlog should NOT be in next.go's Next() 
    * implement parseProlog_test.go 

    * create a tool which calls the pull parser to produce a tree of
        xml OM object as in ../om/.
    * then write a serializer which converts the OM tree to a cannical
        serial form
        - which is guaranteed to round-trip back to the same form

    * Parser struct must contain root Element with semantic properties 
        required by XML spec
        - this is the bottom of the element stack
    * parseDocTypeDecl.go and test need more work (but ok for now)

    * for this to be a pull parser, the parser must know its position
        in the syntax graph, returning a PullEvent at appropriate 
        points (more events if tokenizing)

    VERIFY PRODUCTIONS
    * 1     document --> 22 39 27*
    * 3     S (1 or more whitespace char))
        - FIX: Parser.ExpectS() does not correctly implement this rule
        - CHECK: all use of Parser.SkipS()
        - then rename to Parser.S, expecting 1 or more from 4 rune set

    * move 'implementation of XmlPullParser' from parser.go             * DONE
        into implementation.go                                          * DONE
    * then move code from properties.go into that file

    * verify lexer.go has all functions in xgo/lex/lex_input.go
        - and rearrange the latter into alphabetical order
    * parseXmlDecl must collect its runes, add to Parser struct

    * build skeletal parser as parser.go                                * DONE
        - be able to read and parse first line
            * parseXmlDecl()

    * write parser_test.go, initially testing that reset() works 
        as expected
