    * minimalDocTest sometimes fails because of unexpected S when
        collecting Misc1 - for example ' \n\r\n ' has become ' '
        or '\r\r\r\r has become '\r\r' or ' \t\t\n ' is '\t'
        (about 1 in 6-9 failure rate)
    * parseMisc_test.go: set initial state, devise way to specify
        state if no Misc found

2014-05-31
    * minimalDoc_test needs to be elaborated to include
        - randomized Misc1 after XMLDecl?
            * newlines should be IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE
            * Misc should be nothing or zero or more S or Comment 
                or PI
        - doctypedecl optionally present or absent
        - randomized Misc2 after doctypedecl if present
        - randomized MiscN after empty element
    * so terminating newlines must be removed from XML_DECL and         * DONE
        DOCTYPE_DECL in minimalDoc_test.go (but possibly added          * DONE
        back in as Misc*)                                               * DONE
        - fix the test failure that this causes!

    * FIX: minimalDoc_test is looping                                   * FIXED

    * non-tokenizing rudimentary parser returns four event types:
        {START,END}_DOCUMENT, {START,END}_TAG
    * tokenizing rudimentary parser returns at least _ event types:
        {START,END}_DOCUMENT, {START,END}_TAG plus
        PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION, COMMENT, DOCDECL
    * need thorough tests of proper handling of xmlDecl, Misc*, 
        doctypedecl, attribute-less empty element; these can live
        in minimalDoc_test.go
    * need to factor out detection and handling of Misc*

    * delete local pull branch
    * test handling of BOM

    * implement IsS() which accepts only 0x20, 0x9, 0xa, 0xd            * DONE

    * REVIEW decision to always set p.curEvent when returning
        curEvent

    * get rudimentary parser working (ISSUE#5)
        document ::= prolog element Misc*
        element  ::= EmptyElemTag                                       * DONE
        prolog   ::= XMLDecl? Misc* (doctypedecl Misc*)? 
        Misc     ::= Comment | S
    * Misc* implemented as Parser.acceptMisc

    * parseProlog must be restructured to better match the xml 1.0 
        syntax graph
    * the test for \uFFFE should be moved to whatever calls parseProlog
    * the call to parseProlog should NOT be in next.go's Next() 
    * implement parseProlog_test.go 

    * create a tool which calls the pull parser to produce a tree of
        xml OM object as in ../om/.
    * then write a serializer which converts the OM tree to a cannical
        serial form
        - which is guaranteed to round-trip back to the same form

    * Parser struct must contain root Element with semantic properties 
        required by XML spec
        - this is the bottom of the element stack
    * parseDocTypeDecl.go and test need more work (but ok for now)

    * for this to be a pull parser, the parser must know its position
        in the syntax graph, returning a PullEvent at appropriate 
        points (more events if tokenizing)

    * verify lexer.go has all functions in xgo/lex/lex_input.go
        - and rearrange the latter into alphabetical order
    * parseXmlDecl must collect its runes, add to Parser struct

    * build skeletal parser as parser.go                                * DONE
        - be able to read and parse first line

    * write parser_test.go, initially testing that reset() works
