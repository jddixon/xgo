    * clean up parser.go, holder.go, elsewhere as required,			    * DONE
        removing leftovers from handling blockquotes with			    * DONE
        goroutines (a rough cleanup, need to look at code again)		* DONE

2014-03-08
    * accept HTML *inline* elements
        - verify Markdown IS interpreted in such elements

    * accept HTML *block* elements 
        - verify Markdown not interpreted in such blocks

2014-03-04
    * look at extensions under https://github.com/karlcow/markdown-testsuite
    * consider //http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html

    * verify can round-trip fencedCodeBlock

2014-02-07
    * automatic email addresses: match randomization algorithm!

2014-02-05
    * FIX: para.go claims that each Para has a LineSeq associated with
        it, but there is no such element in the struct
    * add "fencing", 3 or 4 backticks + optional language to start
        codeblock and 3 or 4 backticks to end
        - CodeBlock.String() should produce this
        - See Metastackflow 125148

    * linkReference.go appears to be dead code

2014-01-14
    * xgoMarkdown should be able to parse source trees like
        /usr/local/src/html5-boilerplace/doc/*.md
        which contain links to file names with a .md extension;
        these should automatically be processed into trees which
        can be rendered as HTML

2014-01-09
    * fix: most blockquote tests fail                                   * DONE
2013-12-28
    * handle the 11 blockquote tests

2014-01-01
    * link-idref-angle-bracket requires (?) argument for channel 
        to tell parseHolder() that we are done

2013-12-29
    * then parser should have context stack
    * the various Get() routines should return HTML5 OM, not text
    * need a String() for everything

2013-12-26
    * why can't I declare Document.blocks as []BlockI ?
    * test linkRefSpan with dictionary

2013-12-23
    * loops in parseLinkDefinition are messy; rework to follow 
        those in parseImageDef

2013-12-16
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps
