    * linkReference.go appears to be dead code

2014-01-14
    * xgoMarkdown should be able to parse source trees like
        /usr/local/src/html5-boilerplace/doc/*.md
        which contain links to file names with a .md extension;
        these should automatically be processed into trees which
        can be rendered as HTML

    * fix: most blockquote tests fail

2014-01-01
    * link-idref-angle-bracket requires (?) argument for channel 
        to tell parseHolder() that we are done

2013-12-29
    * then parser should have context stack
    * the various Get() routines should return HTML5 OM, not text
    * need a String() for everything

2013-12-28
    * handle the 11 blockquote tests

2013-12-26
    * why can't I declare Document.blocks as []BlockI ?
    * test linkRefSpan with dictionary

    * loops in parseLinkDefinition are messy; rework to follow 
        those in parseImageDef

2013-12-16
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps
