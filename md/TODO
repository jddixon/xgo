    * consider changing lineSep in type Line to []rune, to allow for
        CR-LF sequences at the end of a line

    * loops in parseLinkDefinition are messy; rework to follow 
        those in parseImageDef

    * linkRefSpan needs working linkRef and dictionary

    * fix test
        - 8/102 tests succeed                                           * DONE
        - 17/102 tests succeed (all simple paragraph tests)             * DONE
    * transform Parse() into type Parser with func Parse()              * DONE
    * 23/102 tests succeed (all em- and strong-)                        * DONE
    * header.*hash non-underlined tests (14)                            * DONE

    * Entities should be handled in html_writer.  We run through the
        runes, ignoring &...; sequences but replacing ambiguous 
        characters with entities where required.
    * To make this simpler, create an HtmlWriter struct with an         * DONE 
        io.Writer for output                                            * DONE

    * current header collector only works on the first line; extend
        to other circumstances
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps

    * horizontal rules (5 tests)
