    * link-idref-angle-bracket represents argument for channel 
        to tell parseHolder() that we are done

2013-12-31
    * Document needs to become a HolderI                                * DONE
        - step 1: []blocks are BlockI, not MarkdownI                    * DONE
    * top level parseHolder
    * possibly lower level parseSpanHolder
    * don't forget clj :-(

2013-12-29
    * add holder.go, where Holder is something that can have children
    * then parser should have context stack
    * the various Get() routines should return HTML5 OM, not text
    * need a String() for everything

2013-12-28
    * FIX ordered.go, which was just hacked from unordered.go           * DONE
        - needs from parameter                                          * DONE

    * handle the 11 blockquote tests
    * add xgo/cmd/xgoMarkDown

2013-12-27
    * need to suppress any lineSep in the last block of Document.Get()  * DONE
        to conform to tests                                             * DONE
    * md*test line 127 appears correct, error is later                  * DONE

2013-12-26
    * in order to serialize Document to string, must be able to
        serialize its dictionary; which means that the dict must
        distinguish link and image definitions
    * why can't I declare Document.blocks as []BlockI ?
    * test linkRefSpan with dictionary

2013-12-23
    * loops in parseLinkDefinition are messy; rework to follow 
        those in parseImageDef

2013-12-16
    * Entities should be handled in html_writer.  We run through the
        runes, ignoring &...; sequences but replacing ambiguous 
        characters with entities where required.
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps
