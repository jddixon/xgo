    * in order to serialize Document to string, must be able to
        serialize its dictionary; which means that the dict must
        distinguish link and image definitions
    * why can't I declare Document.blocks as []BlockI ?
    * FIX: missing LF between Paras                                     * DONE
    * FIX: missing second line from second para                         * DONE
    * add horizontal rule to Parser
    * test linkRefSpan with dictionary

    * Entities should be handled in html_writer.  We run through the
        runes, ignoring &...; sequences but replacing ambiguous 
        characters with entities where required.
    * current header collector only works on the first line; extend     * DONE
        to other circumstances                                          * DONE
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps

    * horizontal rules (5 tests)
