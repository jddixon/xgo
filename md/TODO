    * consider changing lineSep in type Line to []rune, to allow for    * DONE
        CR-LF sequences at the end of a line                            * DONE

    * loops in parseLinkDefinition are messy; rework to follow 
        those in parseImageDef
    
    * header.go compiles                                                * DONE

    * Entities should be handled in html_writer.  We run through the
        runes, ignoring &...; sequences but replacing ambiguous 
        characters with entities where required.
    * To make this simpler, create an HtmlWriter struct with an         * DONE 
        io.Writer for output                                            * DONE

    * current header collector only works on the first line; extend
        to other circumstances
    * a line consisting of nothing but hash signs should simply be 
        output as text; in other words, it gets appended to nonSeps

    * horizontal rules (5 tests)
