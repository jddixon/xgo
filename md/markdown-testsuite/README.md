markdown-testsuite
==================

After starting the [W3C Community Group about Markdown](http://www.w3.org/community/markdown), a question has been raised a few times about a test suite for the markdown syntax.

I decided to put together a list of individual files isolating some constructs of the markdown syntax. Some features might be missing, you know the deal. Pull Requests are welcome.
